## Copyright of `epmdist.h` in Original ART

On the original source code, the copyright notice of `empdist.h` contains a banner indicating that it is copyrighted with all rights reserved. After contacting the original author, I've confirmed that the `empdist.h` can be distributed under the GPL v3 license. The email is as follows:

Dear Zhejian,

It is great that you are using ART codes for your research. No worries about the license
banner in empdist.h. It should be under GPL3.

Thanks!
